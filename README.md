1. Observation of people accepting the coupon

1.1 By plotting histogram of coupon accepted w.r.t to passanger, weather condition, direction and destination large number of coupons were accepted with passanger is alone, destination is not urgent, direction is same and weather is sunny. (passenger.png, destination.png, direction.png and weather.png)
